In this task, I was required to use SQL queries to extract and analyze datasets.  
I done this task using **POSTGRESQL**.
I performed all the necessary operations such as creating tables, inserting values, ordering data, grouping data, 
applying aggregate functions, joining tables using the JOIN clause, and creating indexes on table columns.

The project structure is organized as follows:

**data** folder → contains the dataset used for analysis

**materials** folder → contains the task instructions

**src** folder → contains the SQL file with all the queries and analysis

**Answers.docx** → includes screenshots of the SQL queries along with their outputs
