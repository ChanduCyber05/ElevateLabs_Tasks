This project focuses on cleaning the "marketing_campaign.csv" to prepare it for analysis. 
The dataset originally contained missing values in income column, and inconsistent date formats("Dt_Customer"). 
Using Python (pandas), these issues were resolved by imputing missing values, and standardizing column formats. 
The final output is a clean dataset (task_1.xlsx) ready for further exploration and modeling.
